            <p>
              I am currently a PhD candidate under the supervision of

              and
              <span name="JamesLedoux"></span>.
              I develop solution methods tailored to sparse problems in high-dimensional and continuous settings in
              relation to the automatic detection of liver disease.

              As end-of-study internship for my schooling at

              I worked under the supervision of

              and
              <span name="CedricHerzet"></span>.
              We developed solution methods tailored to two particular cases of sparse problems : the Elastic-Net and
              the L0-penalized Least-Squares problem.
